# CheCko

Basically, CheCko is built as the login system of the ResPeer social application. It could also serve as the Linera blockchain wallet. In CheCko, we implement Linera native token transfer, ERC20-like fungible token transfer, and web3.js apis. The Web application can interact with the Linera blockchain through CheCko, similar to what they do with Metamask.
