Each microchain will be claimed from preset faucet with users' public key.

### Claim microchain

**Note**: After claiming microchain, swap application, ams application, wlinera application and blob gateway application will be requested to created chain automatically. This may be removed later after we can call any application on any chain.

### Validate microchain
